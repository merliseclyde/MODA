Description: The Modal Orthogonal Data Augmentation Package or `MODA`
    finds posterior modes of the model space under generalized ridge
    shrinkage priors with a point mass at zero.  In addtion to finding
    modes, the algorithms provide an exploration of high posterior
    probability models.
